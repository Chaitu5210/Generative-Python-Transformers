# Generative Python Transformers

## Overview
This project focuses on building a generative model using the Transformer architecture in Python. It leverages pre-trained models to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts.

## Objectives
- Implement a generative model using the Transformer architecture.
- Explore various pre-trained models and their applications in text generation.
- Evaluate the model's performance and quality of generated text.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of text for training and fine-tuning.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable pre-trained Transformer model (e.g., GPT-2, BERT).
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the model on the collected dataset to adapt it for specific tasks.
4. **Text Generation**: Generate text based on input prompts and analyze the results.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess the quality of generated text using metrics such as BLEU score and human evaluation.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the capabilities of generative Transformers in producing high-quality text. Further improvements can include exploring different architectures and training techniques.
